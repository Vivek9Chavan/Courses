# Advanced Software Engineering
The aim of the course is to explain students for what purposes, under which conditions and with which consequences computer systems are used for the solution of problems related to Engineering.

Within the first part of the course the steps from problem description to the final software solution are illustrated. This covers the topics modelling, problem elicitation and analysis, program design and an introduction to UML (Unified Modelling Language). Then the course goes on with a closer examination of the various aspects which comprise software development, concerning with topics like design patterns, agile software processes and project management. Parallel to the lecture the students are given the chance to employ the theoretical input from the course in small software projects. After an introduction to the basics of Java and object-oriented programming, the students stepwise pass through the particular stages of a software development process.

# Machine Learning
The goal of Machine Learning is to develop techniques that enable a machine to "learn" how to perform certain tasks from experience.

The important part here is the learning from experience. That is, we do not try to encode the knowledge ourselves, but the machine should learn it itself from training data. The tools for this are statistical learning and probabilistic inference techniques. Such techniques are used in many real-world applications. This lecture will teach the fundamental machine learning know-how that underlies such capabilities. In addition, we show current research developments and how they are applied to solve real-world tasks.

The class is accompanied by exercises that will allow you to collect hands-on experience with the algorithms introduced in the lecture. There will be both pen&paper exercises and practical programming exercises based on Matlab and TensorFlow (1 exercise sheet every 2 weeks).
